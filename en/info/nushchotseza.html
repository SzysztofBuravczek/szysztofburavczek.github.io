<h1>НуЩоЦеЗа<a href="#ftn0" id="ftn0-src0">*</a> - an album that is unlikely to be released</h1>
<p>Szysztof has been making attempts to reflect on the Russo-Ukrainian war<a href="#ftn1" id="ftn1-src0">**</a> and other pressing social problems, if not since 2014<a href="#ftn2" id="ftn2-src0">***</a> then certainly since 2015. But the process was difficult and very slow, and the results didn't satisfy the author. Szysztof wanted the songs to describe not only the current situation, but also the way to fix it.</p>
<p>The trouble is that he didn't have any political consciousness to achieve that goal, not even a clue where to acquire such consciousness. Instead of it Szysztof had a strong fear of getting hit by far-right radicals in case of his works gaining popularity. Therefore, even ready-made songs could not be performed and recorded with sufficient conviction to be published.</p>
<p>The process accelerated in 2019 under the impressions of a trip to the cities of Ukraine, including the Ukrainian-controlled territory of Donbas, as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Ukrainian_presidential_election" title="Wikipedia" target="_blank" class="outer">sensational presidential election</a> campaign and the first year of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy#Presidency" title="Wikipedia" target="_blank" class="outer">Volodymyr Zelensky</a>'s rule. It was then that the name of the album was invented along with the slogan <b lang="ru">"про те, що відбувається"</b> ("on what is happening"), the tracklist was formed, most of the songs got completed lyrics, vocal and guitar part. Much less was recorded though: <a href="../discography/deadlyslope.html" title = "Deadly Slope" lang="en">"Deadly Slope"</a> and <a href="../discography/elections2019.html" title = "Брехня проти брехні" lang="uk">"Брехня проти брехні"</a> at a level sufficient for publication, <a href="../lyrics/ye_eh.html" title = "Є Э - lyrics" lang="mul">"Є Э"</a> as a draft<a href="#ftn3" id="ftn3-src0">****</a> (will be finalized and published later), "Знайомі ями" as "I'll just record myself singing it with a guitar not to forget the damn tune” (the link will be given <a href="#lo-fi">below</a>).</p>
<p>By early 2020, Szysztof had lost confidence that he's the right man to be writing the political songs. These doubts were expressed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fh0SVXCAeY" title="YouTube" target="_blank" class="outer">a talking-head video</a> in Ukrainian, the tracklist of the album was presented, but, alas, mostly as a text not as a soundtrack. And very soon after the video, the coronavirus pandemic became a new source of inspiration, hence the new songs that formed the album "Absurd" (yet to be released).</p>
<p>And, of course, the invasion of February 24, 2022 forced Szysztof to thoroughly rethink his political views. The blurred position "for everything good against everything bad" could neither explain nor guide any longer. While seeking for a clearer idea, Szysztof began to write instrumental music (only one composition has been published at the moment, namely <a href="../discography/willweever.html" title = "Will We Ever Be Able to Waltz Again?" lang="en">"Will We Ever Be Able to Waltz Again?"</a>). He turned to the songs intended for "НуЩоЦеЗа" only in exile, releasing the most anti-war and pro-emigration ones as a mini-album <a href="../discography/hate.html" title = "Ненавидьте, презирайте, отписывайтесь" lang="mul">"Ненавидьте, презирайте, отписывайтесь"</a> one year since the invasion.</p>
<p>A clearer idea was finally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism" title="Wikipedia" target="_blank" class="outer">found</a>, but most of the songs intended for "НуЩоЦеЗа", unfortunately, do not fit into it. Therefore, the album will hardly ever be released in full. Perhaps with a huge disclaimer <b>"LOOK HOW WRONG I WAS!"</b> or with changed texts, but this is extremely unlikely. The published songs will remain online, although Szysztof sees the traces of his past delusions in them. Some unreleased ones survive as draft or live acoustic recordings. If you're interested you can listen to them by the links below, at your own risk.</p>

<div class="comment footnote"><p><span id="ftn0">*</span> Pronounced as NuShchoTseZa, approximate translation from Ukrainian is "OhWhatThe". <a href="#ftn0-src0">^</a></p>
<p><span id="ftn1">**</span> This sequence of tragic events has many names, but let us stick to the name adopted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War" title="Wikipedia" target="_blank" class="outer">Wikipedia</a>. <a href="#ftn1-src0">^</a></p>
<p><span id="ftn2">***</span> The song "А воз и ныне там" ("And things are still there") was written even earlier, in 2013, but was originally dedicated to the protests in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%932013_Russian_protests" title="Wikipedia" target="_blank" class="outer">Russia</a>, not in Ukraine. By the time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euromaidan" title="Wikipedia" target="_blank" class="outer">Euromaidan</a> began, the song already had a ready-made text and structure, as well as one live performance, which was far from success though. At the height of the Euromaidan events, Szysztof tried to make a full recording of the song, but, as usual, the vocals failed. Only a fragment of this recording has survived: an acoustic guitar part from the verse, the chorus, the solo and again the chorus. That fragment was used to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puVc5uEHU3o&t=68" title="YouTube" target="_blank" class="outer">advertise the next live performance</a>. <a href="#ftn2-src0">^</a></p>
<p><span id="ftn3">****</span> Video footage was filmed to release the song as a lyric video, similar to <a href="../discography/deadlyslope.html" title = "Deadly Slope" lang="en">"Deadly Slope"</a>. A drawing, which is now the cover of this article, was even <a href="https://www.facebook.com/szysztof/posts/pfbid0ReVFeKBpNBSMq4beVGZC9MYg9rSbvHrcXYMVxZ6QcEh77FaDGVpESCNaj9T6VpTol" target="_blank" class="outer">published</a> along with a call to spread the <b>#єэ</b> hashtag and to make similar drawings. But no flash mob started, so Szysztof’s self-esteem was hurt, and his motivation to finish the recording decreased. Although, of course, the main reason why the song could not be released before 2023 was the insufficiently developed emotional range of the vocals. <a href="#ftn3-src0">^</a></p>
<p><span id="ftn4">*****</span> "Великий Льох" is the name of the mystery poem by Taras Shevchenko. "The Great Mound" is the only translation which could be easily googled and which suits much better than the literal translation "The Great Cellar". Google Translate gave a good alternative translation though: "The Great Crypt". <a href="#ftn4-src0">^</a></p></div></main>
